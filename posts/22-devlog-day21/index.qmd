As you can see I am not a particularly gifted artist but for the game jam I need to make an idea for a character.  
To avoid needing details I covered most of the face with "mask" so all I would need is some basic eyes.  
Drew inspiration from Hollow Knight, pikmin, and EVA from Walle all as inspiration for simple but pleasant character designs to emulate.  
I threw pics of all those plus more on Krita to use as reference images.  
Now I need to digitize this image and create some variations for sprite animations.  
Plus the stage and background but I'll get there hopefully.  

## Godot loot done
I comleted the full module today.  
The last bits were wrapping the ship around the edge of the screen when it hit.  
Use `wrapf` for that with the the viewport size `get_viewport_rect`.  

Last bit was to make the items appear to float even though their collision shapes did not actually follow the floatiness.  
There is a class called `Tween` that is dedicated to tweaking properities of nodes to add some animation effects in place.  
`create_tween`  
`tween.set_trans(<TWEEN_TRANS_ENUM>)` (choose which type of interpolation to give smoothness)  
`tween.tween_property(sprite_2d, "position" or prop, new_value, duration)`  
`tween.set_loops()` loop the tween animation forever or set a value  


Thanks for reading!
