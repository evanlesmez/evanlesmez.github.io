## Vim windows
Today I learned about splitting and managing windows in Vim.  
I had some experience with this before but it was a good refresher.  
My problem is that I sometimes get mixed up with tmux cmds and Vim ones.  
In tmux, Ctrl-B is the beginning of commands.  
In Vim, Ctrl-W is the beginning of window commands.  

```sh
<Ctrl-w>s # split window intro rows
<Ctrl-w>v # split window vertically into columns
:sp {file} # split rows loading file into new window
:vsp {file} # split cols loading file into new window

<Ctrl-w>w or <Ctrl-w> # cycle between windows
# you can also ctrl-w into any hjkl move

:clo # close active window but use :q its easier or <Ctrl-w>c
:on[ly] or <Ctrl-w>o # close all other windows except current
<Ctrl-w>= # equalize the dimensions of all windows
<Ctrl-w>_ # max the current window height
<Ctrl-w>| # max the current window width

# Moving windows
<Ctrl-w>r or R # rotates the windows for viewing
<Ctrl-w>x # swap neighbor window for current
<Ctrl-w>[hjkl] # bring window to the top of that direction
```
The moving section came from this [vimcast on Vim windows](http://vimcasts.org/episodes/working-with-windows/).
