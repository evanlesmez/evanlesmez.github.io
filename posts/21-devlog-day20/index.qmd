I am traveling right now so did not have much time to progress on lessons.  
I checked the theme for the DC game jam when it came out <https://itch.io/jam/district-jam-5>.  
Did some brainstorming with friends and on my own.  
Also figured out how to launch nvim as script editor from with Godot on creating/edit scripts.  
Lastly came up with a plan:  

1. Figure out git in Godot editor
2. Pureref vision board of characers like calcifer and charmander ...
3. Inkscape make some rough drawings on inkscape of the main character
4. Hand draw some ideas for the background abd stage
5. Get Erica involved with some sound and music ideas based on the setting
6. Sprite movement
7. Practice export game build
8. Animate
9. hidden
10. hidden 
11. UI if time
