Today I completed the intro to GDSript games and learned a few interesting things:  

The `_process` builtin function is the "game loop" of Godot to place code that needs to trigger every frame.  
It has a parameter called 'delta'.  
Delta is a time difference since the previous frame.  
Referencing delta in calculations helps the game feel more smooth across various frame rates.  
`lerp` is a function that returns a weighted average between two values (linear interpolation).  
You can auto type hint with the `:=` operator like `var name := "gibby"`.  
Most importantly, GDScript is basically Python.  

Up next is working on a top-down action game in space.
