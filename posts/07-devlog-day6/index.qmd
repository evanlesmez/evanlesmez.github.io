I practiced some Vim today in the same Practical Vim book.  
Learned that Vim writes history to `vim info` file that persists across machine boots.  
The history is not only execute commands but also search patterns and I am sure other commands.  
In execute command mode `Ctrl-d`.  
`*` in normal mode searches for the hovered word.  
`<C-r><C-w>` in execute mode copies the current word in as pattern for things like substitutions.  

In Godot, I practiced making a space ship move with player inputs.  
The most important parts were adding the controls in the Project settings.  
The `direction` is stored as a `2DVector`.  
The `Input` object has an `axis` method that accepts two input arguments like "move_down" or "move_up" to map values between -1 and 1 to.  
`direction` is updated to match these values and then scaled by whatever speed is desired.  
Lastly, the `direction` vector must be `normalized` if the `length` is above 1.0 which happens when moving diagonally which would make the ship move 1.4 times faster #pythagoreantheorum.
