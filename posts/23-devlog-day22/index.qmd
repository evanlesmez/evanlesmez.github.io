## Vim

Display line movement  

```vim
gj # go down one display line useful for line wrapping
gk # go up one display line useful for line wrapping  
g0 # first char of display line
g^ # first nonblank char of display line
g$ # end of display line
```
word-wise movement  

```vim
w # forward start of next word
b # backward to start of current or prev word
e # end of current or next word
ge # backward to end of current or prev word
```

words are smaller than WORDS  

```vim
w # move word wise (sequenmces seperated by "." " " "," "'" ...)
W # move WORD wise (sequences seperated by blank space)
```

## Godot
Worked on the game for the "sizzle" themed gamejam.  
My game is most certainly not sizzling.  
But at least I got a player moving after struggling with `TileSet` and `TileMapLayer` for way too long.  
Tileset seems to be a .png file that provides seperated sprites to be used for repeating patterns aka tiles.  
TileMapLayer takes the art from a TileSet and give it important properties like Physics for collisions so a character does not fall through the floor.  
Also important, they allow selecting tiles to then paint into the scene.  

After painting some basic tiles I borrowed from [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/assets/abstract-platformer), I added some basic player movement for jumping and moving left and right.  
Took me a few minutes to find `Input.is_action_pressed` again in the docs.  
Once I did though, I then ran into a new problem.  
I forgot about gravity.

## Misc
`screenkey` is a cool tool to record keys being entered.  
Learned about it from the Primeagen.  

Thanks for reading!
