It worked!  
I put the new battery in place, put it into the 20V (19V compatible) DC output mode, and then with a barrel adapter, connected the the DC out of the battery to the mini PC.  
I then went through the process of installing a Linux OS and setting up some programs which ended up taking a few hours.
