I have always wanted to tinker around with the i3 tiling window manager.  
Recently I started using Pop_OS! tiling feature, and installed `komorebi` on my Windows gaming machine to replicate.  
In doing so, I realized tiling feels way nicer than the default stacking behavior common to most display managers.  

So I took the plunge in setting up i3 and love it!

The keybindings are nice and configurable.  
I changed my mod key to be the Win key.  
`Win+<CR>` creates a new terminal.  
`Win+[h,j,k,l]` goes to the window on the screen in that direction (vim motions).  
`Win+d` opens dmenu to choose a program. Critical.  
`Win+{N}` goes to workspace N. Incredibly handy.  
`Win+Shift+{N}` moves window to workspace N. Also incredibly handy starting out.  
`Win+Shift+q` close window.  
There are so many more but even with these it feels so comfortable.  

Note to get a nice background I used `feh` and to add opacity I used `picom` as a compositor.
