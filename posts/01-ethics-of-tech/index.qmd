In 1939, IBM's president Thomas Watson approved the release of the company's specialized alphabetizing machines to help organize the deportation of Polish Jews for Nazi Germany.  
The IBM executives strategically marketed directly to Hitler and his leadership team to setup the deal.  
A few years earlier, IBM CEO Tom Watson Sr. was awarded a "Service to the Reich" medal. IBM setup a punchard system that tracked the way each person was killed and which ethnic group they belonged to.  
These machines required training and maintenance so IBM employees would regularly show up onsite at concentration camps to operate and repair them. 
IBM was thriving financially and technologically, but at what cost to humanity?
