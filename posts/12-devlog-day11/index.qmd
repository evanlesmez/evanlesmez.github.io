Only had time for some gamedev today.  
I learned a lot about [memcached](https://www.memcached.org) though which is an earlier, kind of worse version of redis.  
Useful for caching DB queries and probably other expensive data fetching services.  
Also in turn learned about telnet which is an earlier, definetly worse version of SSH.  
Worse because it has no encryption and the protocol for communicating with the server is not as intuitive.  
Useful for LAN servers though, especially old ones that don't support SSH.  

Completely tangential, I got more into tiling window management and discovered [komorebi](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi) for Windows.  
On Linux distributions i3 and other programs are available but it is nice to have an option for Windows so my desktop can look like this.

## Health pickups
<img src="./health-pack-pickups.gif" style="max-height:40em;max-width:100%"/>  

In the gif, you see the ship driving around and picking up the health packs.  
In the remote scene tree on the left, the nodes of the health packs are removed once picked up.  
This is from the signals emited from the `Area2D` nodes that have a callback to `queue_free`.  
A common node pattern seems to be:  
```txt
Area2D
|_ Sprite2D
  - texture
  |_ GPUParticles or ther Sprite2Ds or Line2Ds
|_ CollisionShape2D
  - shape
```

Thank for reading.
