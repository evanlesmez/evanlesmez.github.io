## Vim
### Tabs
`:h tabpage`  

Tabs in Vim are similar to tabs in other programs however the key difference is that one tab in Vim does not map to one file.  
Instead, a tab in vim can have several buffers within it as well a window panes that show those buffers.

Here are the commands:  

```sh
:lcd # set the working dir for the current window
:tabe {filename} # like edit but open buffer in new tab
<C-w>T # break the window pane into a new tab
:tabc # close current tab
:tabo # close other tabs
:tabn or gt # next tab
:tabp or gT # prev tab
:tabmove {N} # move the Nth tab to beginning
```

### Files

I also learned about how to open files to buffers quicker rather than typing out full paths.  
I already had discovered the `%` in command mode which represents the current buffer's filepath.  
Combine it into `: %:h` and press <Tab> and the full path to the current buffer is completed for you.  
This is handy for when you opened Vim at the root project dir but are opening files nested a few folders down.  
If you already have one open, instead of typing out path from root, you can type the path out relative to the current folder.
