Today I completed the tour of Godot game made by the GDQuest creators.  
Learned about TileMap nodes to create repeating visual 2D blocks used in old games like Zelda.  
Used "Terrains" to create instances of the TileMaps faster.  
Collision shapes like invisible walls can be represented by shapes in the scene editor to convey that a space is off limits.  
Repeated using a signal to hook up a player node to a UI health bar when an enemy did damage.  


Note:  
Backgrounds add a lot to the feel of a game as does looting a chest.  

I asked a question in the last lesson about any gamedev podcast recommendations.  
Not exactly gamedev, but the creator of the course recommended theprimegean so I watched a few videos today about Vim and made me want to get back on switching to neovim as my editor.  
Currently I use vim mode wherever possible such as VSCode, Jupyter Lab, Obsidian ...  
I did setup neovim with some Lua plugins but was still too slow compared to working in VS Code for basic things like creating a new file, copying files, searching through all the files for a class...  
But might be time to start trying again.  
Found some Godot 4 Vim binding plugins for GDScript which will be helpful.  

Tomorrow I will be moving onto the [next lesson on GDScript](https://school.gdquest.com/courses/learn_2d_gamedev_godot_4/learn_gdscript/learn_gdscript_app).
