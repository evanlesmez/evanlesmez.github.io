Today I learned about GDScript, Godot's scripting language.  
It looks like a blend of Python and Javascript.  
Python because of the indentation and Javascript because of the var keyword used for creating variables.  
I did not have as much time today so I did about 3 of the starter lessons.  Most of it was a little too simple but did at least learn some syntax and a few builtin functions.  

```py
# shows a game entity like a character
show()

# hides the entity
hide()

# what you would expect
rotate(radians:float)
```

Used those to make this turtle draw some rectangles.
